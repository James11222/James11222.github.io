							In my time at UC Berkeley as a double major in Astrophysics and Physics, I have found that I am most passionate 
							about computational astrophysics. I love simulating the universe on a computer. There is something so 
							satisfying about seeing a beautiful simulation of a physical system in our universe. I am passionate about 
							simulating a wide range systems in astrophysics, anything from Magnetohydrodynamics of gasses in the 
							Interstellar Medium to large scale cosmological simulations of the universe like IllustrisTNG. 
							I romanticize the idea of being able to simulate the entire universe on a computer so much that I want to 
							pursue that dream for the rest of my academic career. As of yet, my research projects have consisted of the
							following: Observational Cosmology under Prof. Filippenko, simulating mixing layers in the ISM with Athena++ 
							under Michael Jennings, theoretical research on the plausibility of measuring the Hubble Constant using dynamical
							tides in inspiraling neutron star binaries under guidance of Dr. Hang Yu, and a multi-scale morphological
							analysis on the effects of baryonic matter on structure formation in cosmological simulations under guidance 
							of Dr. Jia Lu of UC Berkeley.

								<b><a id="Mixing_Layers">Mixing Layers ULAB Project</a></b><br><br>
								In my second year of undergrad I had the opportunity to be a part of the Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley 
								research program. In this program my group’s research was focused on computational astrophysics concerning mixing
								layers in the interstellar medium. This has taught me a lot about how to use C++ as a tool for simulating 
								magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon. In this project we used the open source code Athena++ as a basis for creating 
								our own problem generator to model the interstellar medium. I was mentored by a fellow undergraduate student by 
								the name of Michael Jennings. In this project I discovered my love of computational astrophysics. In this project 
								I learned how to run MHD simulations using the library Athena++. Tasks involved writing problem generators in C++, 
								learning to use GitHub and UNIX, and some elementary lessons in astrophysical fluid dynamics.

								<b><a id="LIGO_SURF">LIGO Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship</a></b><br><br>
								I had the privilege of being selected to be a participant in the LIGO SURF program in Summer 2020. In this program 
								I worked closely with Dr. Hang Yu to investigate measuring the Hubble Constant using dynamical tides in inspiraling 
								neutron star binaries. <br>

								<br><b>Abstract:</b><br>
								
								<br>
								The “Hubble Tension” is a large, newfangled problem in astronomy which has even larger cosmological consequences in 
								its eventual resolve. Currently all calibration methods of the constant rely on the use of the electromagnetic 
								spectrum-a method that does not rely on EM light but instead solely on gravitational radiation could prove extremely 
								useful as both a backup for the unreliability of multi-messenger astronomy at its current state and as a new lens 
								into cosmology which could potentially expand our understanding of light, gravity, and the universe. To extract a 
								cosmological redshift from a gravitational waveform, one can look at both the point particle approximation phase 
								contribution and the tidal phase contribution to the total phase of a gravitational waveform which allows for a break
								in the redshift degeneracy found in the mass parameters, which we can exploit to extract a cosmological redshift and 
								thus the Hubble constant. Our analysis incorporates both f-modes and r-modes into the tidal phase contribution that 
								are found in binary neutron star inspirals. We use the Fisher Matrix Analysis to generate our relevant possible errors
								on each parameter of the waveform. <br><br>
								<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdxmxVIST8&t=1s">Here is a presentation</a>
								 I gave of my research in my research seminar course at UC Berkeley. In the audience is Professor
								Mariska Kriek and my fellow peers. Below is the link to the iPoster I presented at the 237th American Astronomical 
								Society Meeting (click on the image to access the full interactive poster). <br><br>

								<b><a id="obs_astro">Observational Astronomy - Filippenko Research Group</a></b><br><br>
								
								As a member of the Filippenko Research Group at UC Berkeley I am responsible for monthly observing runs with the 
								Nickel 1m telescope at Lick Observatory. On these observing runs we do follow-up observations on recent 
								supernovae, transient objects, and globular clusters. I am also a member of the Zwicky Transient Facility 
								checking team which identifies potential supernovae to do follow up studies on. In this research group my 
								primary project has been to help develop a software package known as astroPIPS which is a Period Identification
								and Pipeline Suite for detecting periods of variable objects such as RR Lyrae Variable Stars, Cepheid Variable 
								Stars, and potentially exoplanets. My role was to implement stellar parameter estimation models for RRab and RRc 
								type variable stars. With the multi-term Fourier fitting to a folded light curve we can estimate stellar 
								properties using empirically derived models. This software package is openly available now at 
								<a href="https://pypi.org/project/astroPIPS/">pypi.org/project/astroPIPS/</a>. 
								Our project is currently observing variable stars in the M3 globular cluster to investigate Oosterhoff Types and better
								understand the evolutionary path of variable stars. In this project I have begun making use of the 1D MHD stellar simulation
								code MESA to simulate RR Lyrae light curves which we can compare to observed data which may allow us to investigate the effects 
								of metallicity in RR Lyraes further than ever before.
								<br><br>
								Recently the group has begun participating in the race for discovering Kilonovae (BNS and BHNS mergers). We are constantly on the 
								look out for new gravitational wave events from the LIGO & VIRGO gravitational wave observatories. One of our goals is to discover optical
								counterparts for a binary neutron star mergers or a neutron star-black hole mergers. Finding these optical counterparts would allow the group
								to recalibrate the Hubble constant and help address the Hubble tension in the scientific community. I am currently being trained to operate the
								Shane Telescope (3-meter) at Lick as well. This training requires extensive knowledge of how to utilize the Kast Double Spectrograph instrument
								for taking spectroscopic data of supernovae and other target objects.
								<br><br>
								In this research group, we often host workshops and journal clubs for new undergrads to learn from. Below is a presentation I gave for the group 
								as a crash course introduction to Python.

								<b>Teaching:</b>
								<br><br>
								As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, I have found several opportunities to get involved with
								the teaching side of university. In my 3rd year I taught two courses at Cal; Introduction to General 
								Astronomy (Astro C10) and Introduction to Python for Astronomers (Python DeCal). My roles are slightly
								different for each course. I am an Undergraduate Student Instructor (UGSI) for Astro C10 and I am a student
								facilitator for the Python DeCal. In my UGSI role, I host 4 discussion sections a week with my students where
								I give mini lectures, review sessions, create worksheets and activities, host office hours, and administer my own 
								quizzes. Altogether I teach over 120 students as an UGSI for Astro C10. At the same time, I also facilitate the
								Python DeCal with my friends Yilun, Emily, Raphael, and Ayla where we have nearly 20 students, which entails creating homework 
								assignments, giving weekly lectures, grading homework and projects, and hosting office hours. Teaching both of
								these courses concurrently is a huge undertaking but teaching truly makes me happy. My first semester teaching was 
								entirely virtual which brought many challenges but using techniques from my Teaching Pedagogy course, I did my best 
								to make the courses as enjoyable as possible. Below is our optional “class pictures” to commemorate arguably the
								craziest semester in history.

								<b>Outreach:</b>
								<br><br>
								<b>WOW Science</b>
								<br><br>
								I love educating people about science. Because I love it so much, I started 
								working with the World of Wonders Science Museum towards the end of high school. 
								This included a collaboration with a friend of mine to write and present two lessons 
								to middle school students.
								<br><br>
								After my first year of college I went back to the museum and started a part time job at
								the WOW. Now I help the museum by writing lesson plans, helping teach in the outreach 
								program known as WOW on Wheels, and teach and organize camps. I also got to create and 
								teach the Lunar School for the Apollo 50th Anniversary. I have been certified to run Lodi 
								Unified School District’s very own StarLab planetarium dome. This is a perfect way for me to
								inspire kids like those who inspired me to become a scientist.
