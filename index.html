								<b>Education:</b>
								<br>
								Princeton University <br>
								<i>Hertz Fellow</i> <br>
								&emsp; &emsp;PhD in Astrophysical Sciences (Expected 2028)
								<br>
								University of California, Berkeley <br>
								&emsp; &emsp;B.A. in Physics and Astrophysics with High Distinction (2022)
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								<br><br>
								I love computational astrophysics and cosmology. My current focus is on 
								studying how baryonic matter influences the evolution of our universe through
								theory, simulations, and observations. If there's a lot of data, clever 
								algorithm design, simulations, or pretty plots, I'm in! I also have interests in 
								machine learning, high-energy phenomenon, and magnetohydrodynamics.

								<b>About Me:</b>
								<br><br>

								My life has been a constant game of pinball. I grew up in California bouncing up and down the state, until I 
								eventually landed in the small town of Lodi, CA. From there, I went to UC Berkeley to study physics and
								astronomy. After 22 years of life in California I was eager for a change of scenery. Shortly after receiving my bachelors, I began my PhD across the 
								country in the department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University as a Fellow of the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation. 
								<br><br>
								I love learning and teaching others. I get a great joy out of helping others achieve an understanding of 
								the universe that I had to work hard to achieve. 
								When i'm not studying the universe or teaching others about it, i'm usually playing guitar or
								coding up some random fun side project that has absolutely no connection to my work whatsoever. If you are interested in working with me 
								or would just like to chat, feel free to reach out!
								<br><br>
								Note: If you are applying for the Hertz Fellowship, I wrote a blog documenting my experience as 
								an applicant studying astronomy. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/James11222/Hertz_Experience">here</a>.
