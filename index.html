								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								<br><br>
								 I am most interested in Computational Astrophysics. I am most passionate about 
								simulating magnetohydrodynamics, cosmology, and numerical relativity of compact 
								objects. I also have a strong interest in observation of supernovae, compact objects,
								and other extreme astrophysical phenomena.

								<b>Personal Statement:</b>
								<br><br>
								As the oldest of a big family, learning and helping others is what I love to do. My high school was 
								located in a small town called Lodi in California. I am currently a physics and astrophysics double major
								at University of California Berkeley. Because learning new and interesting things is my passion, I love all
								of science from the smallest quarks to the largest superclusters and everything in between. In addition to my
								love of science, Iâ€™m an avid Ukulele and Guitar player, magician, and digital artist.
								<br><br>
								Because I aspire to have an educational role in academia and become an educator of physics and astrophysics,
								I am currently on the graduate school track, and plan to get a PhD in the future. I want to be a role model and
								an inspiration for the next generations of the world. Currently, I teach at the World of Wonders Science Museum 
								during my summer and winter breaks from college because I enjoy educating the public on really interesting scientific 
								topics and discoveries. This includes writing lesson plans, assisting with camps and events, and teaching with the
								outreach program known as WOW on Wheels.
