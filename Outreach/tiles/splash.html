							<h1>Splash at Berkeley</h1>
							<p>Splash at Berkeley brings local high school students to the University of California, 
								Berkeley for a day of unlimited student-led learning. Participating students take courses 
								in both conventional and unconventional subjects taught by Berkeley students 
								(occasionally other university students).The goal of splash is to build a unique educational environment not found within
								 the standard school curriculum. Students are exposed to topics that they wouldnâ€™t
								  normally have access to and are empowered to take ownership of their education.</p>
					
							<p>Splash at Berkeley is a registered student organization acting 
								independently of the University of California. The student organization
								 is the host of Berkeley Splash and takes full responsibility for the guests. For more information on
								Splash please visit their website: <a href="https://berkeley.learningu.org"><u><b>berkeley.learningu.org</b></u></a></p>

							<p>I taught a lesson to high school students on how to write a video game in python! It was an ambitious lesson, but I lay 
								down the fundamentals of programming by building the game commonly known as pong in python. Then I tie the concepts 
								we learned into numerical astrophysics research by showing them how the concepts we learned in the lecture are used 
								to run numerical simulations of cosmology, magnetohydrodynamics, etc... The students loved it and many of them were 
								inspired to learn more about astrophysics afterwards!
