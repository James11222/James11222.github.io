							<h1>Kesem</h1>
							<p>
								Kesem is a national non-profit organization designed to help children through and beyond 
								a parent's cancer. I have been an active member of the Kesem Berkeley community for majority 
								of my time at UC Berkeley. Kesem holds a special place in my heart because it makes a real impact
								on the lives of so many children who are going through huge amounts of adversity. I contribute to 
								Kesem as a summer camp counselor, unit leader, and as a program counselor. We fundraise year round 
								to put on a huge summer camp for over 200+ students in the bay area free of charge to the camper families.
								With our funds we also support our campers year round through fun Friends and Family days as well. I use 
								my experience with teaching and love of science to help create fun science curriculum for the kids across
								all ages from as young as 5 years of age to seniors in high school. Our chapter at Berkeley is entirely
								run by college students.
							</p>
				
							<p>
								Kesem is a magical space for these kids. For so many of these kids, it is a vital support network 
								that helps them through the struggles they might be facing. This organization has played a vital 
								role in shaping me as a person. If you would like to learn more about the organization please

								can also click on the image below to watch a short video from our first week of in-person camp after the start of the pandemic.
