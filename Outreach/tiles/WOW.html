							<h1>WOW Science</h1>
							<p>
								I love educating people about science. I started 
								working with the World of Wonders Science Museum towards the end of high school. 
								This included a collaboration with my friend Darby McCauley to write and present two lessons 
								to middle school students.
								<br><br>
								After my first year of college I went back to the museum and started a part time job at
								the WOW. Now I help the museum by writing lesson plans, helping teach in the outreach 
								program known as WOW on Wheels, and teach and organize summer camps. I also got to create and 
								teach the Lunar School for the Apollo 50th Anniversary. I am certified to run Lodi 
								Unified School Districtâ€™s very own StarLab planetarium dome. Inspiring kids to learn more about science is 
								one of my favorite ways to make a difference in the world. Please check out the
								<a href="https://www.wowsciencemuseum.org"><u><b>WOW SCIENCE MUSEUM</b></u></a> and consider visiting. In my time 
								at the WOW I have written several unique and engaging lesson plans for students: <em>Art of Alchemy, Narrowing on Newton, Solar System and Beyond II,
								What is Gravity, Lunar School, and more.</em>
								<br><br>
								Below is a fun picture with the kids from the <em>Art of Alchemy</em> lesson I co-wrote with my friend Darby.
