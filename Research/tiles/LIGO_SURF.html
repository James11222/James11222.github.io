								I had the privilege of being selected to be a participant in the LIGO SURF program in Summer 2020. In this program 
								I worked closely with Dr. Hang Yu to investigate measuring the Hubble Constant using dynamical tides in inspiraling 
								neutron star binaries. For a quick read, you can check out this 
								<a href="https://astrobites.org/2021/05/16/ur-measuring-the-hubble-constant-with-dynamical-tides-in-inspiraling-neutron-star-binaries/"><b>Astrobites Post</b></a> 
								I wrote on this research project.<br> 

								<br><b>Abstract:</b><br>
								
								<br>
								The “Hubble Tension” is a large, newfangled problem in astronomy which has even larger cosmological consequences in 
								its eventual resolve. Currently all calibration methods of the constant rely on the use of the electromagnetic 
								spectrum-a method that does not rely on EM light but instead solely on gravitational radiation could prove extremely 
								useful as both a backup for the unreliability of multi-messenger astronomy at its current state and as a new lens 
								into cosmology which could potentially expand our understanding of light, gravity, and the universe. To extract a 
								cosmological redshift from a gravitational waveform, one can look at both the point particle approximation phase 
								contribution and the tidal phase contribution to the total phase of a gravitational waveform which allows for a break
								in the redshift degeneracy found in the mass parameters, which we can exploit to extract a cosmological redshift and 
								thus the Hubble constant. Our analysis incorporates both f-modes and r-modes into the tidal phase contribution that 
								are found in binary neutron star inspirals. We use the Fisher Matrix Analysis to generate our relevant possible errors
								on each parameter of the waveform. <br><br>
