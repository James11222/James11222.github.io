								In my second year of undergrad I had the opportunity to be a part of the Undergraduate Laboratory at Berkeley 
								research program. In this program my groupâ€™s research was focused on computational astrophysics concerning mixing
								layers in the interstellar medium. This has taught me a lot about how to use C++ as a tool for simulating 
								magnetohydrodynamical phenomenon. In this project we used the open source code Athena++ as a basis for creating 
								our own problem generator to model the interstellar medium. I was mentored by a fellow undergraduate student by 
								the name of Michael Jennings. In this project I discovered my love of computational astrophysics. In this project 
								I learned how to run MHD simulations using the library Athena++. Tasks involved writing problem generators in C++, 
								learning to use GitHub and UNIX, and some elementary lessons in astrophysical fluid dynamics.
